== Requirements ==
Yii 1.0 or above

== Installation ==
Extract the release file under `protected/extensions`

== Usage ==
Choose a location to store the photos: eg. /images/gallery

Create some "albums" in the gallery and put your photos (and optional [DescriptionTxt description.txt]) in there eg.

{{{
+-images/
  +-gallery/
    +-sample/
    | +-image1.jpg
    | +-image2.jpg
    +-sample2/
    | +-image4.jpg
    | +-image5.jpg
    +-sample3/
      +-description.txt
      +-image6.jpg
      +-image7.jpg
}}}

If you name your folder by date (eg. 20091120) and create a [DescriptionTxt description.txt] you can sort your gallery [EGalleryProperties by date], but show whatever album title you want.

=== Add the following code to your view: ===
{{{
$this->widget('application.extensions.gallery.EGallery',
        array('path' => '/images/gallery',
            // 'other' => 'properties',
            )
    );
}}}
